# Working Agreement

* No Drift: Follow ROLE_STANDARDS + OUTPUT_SPEC. Deviations recorded in DECISION_LOG with rationale.
* Sequential: One task at a time; no parallelism.
* Full File Replacements: Output complete files unless PATCH explicitly requested.
* Deterministic: Use CHECKLISTS before marking done.
* Security: No PII in logs. Sanitize examples. Enforce validation defaults.
* Licensing: Never paste/redistribute third-party comps or proprietary content.
