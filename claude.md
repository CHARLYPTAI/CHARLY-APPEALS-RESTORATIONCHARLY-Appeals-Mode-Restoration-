# CLAUDE EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

## Context
You are helping restore CHARLY’s Apple-quality Appeals Mode using the full 1802-line `Appeals.tsx` file. Your job is not to guess or invent — follow the steps below.

## Your Mission
- Use `tasks.md` as the execution list.
- Begin with the first unchecked item.
- After completing each task, mark it with [x].
- Only one task at a time. Wait for user feedback after each step.
- NEVER replace full files unless instructed. Only confirm, audit, or explain what's needed.

## Rules
- NO hallucinated components
- NO new folder names
- DO NOT guess variable names or interfaces
- DO NOT overwrite working code
- ASK before modifying any 1000+ line file

## Execution Start
Begin by confirming the 1802-line `Appeals.tsx` is mounted correctly into the intelligent canvas switcher. Report once that is visually confirmed or repaired.
