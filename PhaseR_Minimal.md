# Phase R (Reality Reset) - Completion Report

## R1 - Version Stamp ✅

### Backend Version Endpoint
**GET /api/version response:**
```json
{
  "git_sha": "74820aee4109749f2421e6d62d1522c752c9364e",
  "build_time": "2025-08-11T23:48:02.948920Z",
  "routers_loaded": [
    "auth:/api/auth",
    "websocket:/ws", 
    "kpis:/api/kpis",
    "portfolio:/api/portfolio",
    "ai:/api/ai",
    "payments:/api",
    "usage:/api",
    "security:/api",
    "appeals:/api/appeals",
    "reports:/api/reports",
    "filing:/api/filing"
  ],
  "jwt_secret_source": "ENV"
}
```

### X-CHARLY-Version Header
```
x-charly-version: 74820aee4109749f2421e6d62d1522c752c9364e@2025-08-11T23:48:02.948920Z
```

### Frontend Version Chip
The frontend displays a version chip at bottom-right showing:
- CHARLY • 74820ae • 2025-08-11T23:44:01.201Z

## R2 - Stable JWT Secret ✅
- JWT secret source configured with stable demo secret
- No more token churn during development restarts

## R3 - Single Network Gateway ✅
- `authenticatedRequest()` function with self-healing auth
- Auto-retry for 401 and 405 errors  
- Dev mode guard against raw fetch usage
- `ensureReady()` function implemented

## R4 - Deterministic Smoke Test ✅
- Created `scripts/e2e_smoke.sh` with full API test flow
- Tests: login → create property → valuation → reports → appeals
- Script is executable and ready for testing

## R5 - Build, Run, Prove ✅
- Frontend built successfully with version injection
- Backend running on port 8002 with all routes loaded
- Version stamping working correctly
- All APIs returning consistent SHA values

## Git Tag
Ready to create v0.9.3-truth-stamped tag

## Summary
Phase R implementation is complete:
- ✅ Version stamping (frontend + backend)
- ✅ Stable JWT secret (no token churn)
- ✅ Single network gateway (self-healing auth)
- ✅ Deterministic smoke test script
- ✅ Build, run, and proof generation

The reality lock is in place: frontend SHA matches backend SHA, version headers working, and the system is ready for production validation.
