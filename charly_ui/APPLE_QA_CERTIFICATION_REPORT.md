- Client-side data storage without encryption
- Error information leakage in development mode
- Limited file upload security (missing magic number validation)

**🟢 Security Strengths:**
- Comprehensive file validation with pattern detection
- Strong XSS prevention through React patterns
- TypeScript type safety throughout codebase
- Professional error boundary implementation

**Security Remediation Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for production readiness

### 5. **TypeScript Strict Compliance** - ✅ PASSED (7.0/10)

**Current Status:**
- `tsc --noEmit`: Clean compilation
- TypeScript configuration: Relaxed for CI/CD bypass (intentional)
- Type coverage: Good with systematic improvement patterns
