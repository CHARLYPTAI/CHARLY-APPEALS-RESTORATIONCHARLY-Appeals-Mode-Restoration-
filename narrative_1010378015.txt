## Assessment History

Upon a thorough review of the assessed value of the subject property, it appears that the property has been valued at $13,168,420.00, which translates to an assessed rate of $313.00 per square foot. When compared to the prevailing market norms, this valuation appears to be significantly higher. It is important to consider that the average market rate per square foot in this locality is considerably lower, suggesting that the assessment may not accurately reflect the true market value of the property. This discrepancy could be due to a variety of factors, such as an overestimation of the property's size, condition, or unique features. It is therefore recommended that the property's assessed value be reviewed and adjusted to more accurately align with the market norms, to ensure a fair and equitable property tax assessment.


## Valuation Method

Subject Property: Year Built 1900, Building Class B

Appeal Narrative:

The subject property, a Class B building constructed in 1900, has been flagged for potential overassessment. The property is currently assessed at $313.0/SF, significantly above the market median of $117.0/SF. This discrepancy suggests a possible overvaluation of the property, which may result in an unjustly high property tax burden for the owner. 

In addition, the cost approach to property valuation is not recommended for this property. The cost approach, which estimates the value of a property by calculating the cost to replace it with a similar one, may not be accurate for older properties like this one. Given the property's age, it is likely subject to major depreciation and obsolescence. These factors can significantly lower the property's value, making the cost approach an unsuitable method of valuation.

Instead, it is suggested to use either the income or sales approach to value the property. The income approach, which estimates the property's value based on the income it generates, could be a more accurate method of valuation if the property is income-producing. Alternatively, the sales approach, which estimates the property's value based on recent sales of comparable properties, could provide a more accurate estimate of the property's market value.

In conclusion, due to the property's age and suspected overassessment, it is recommended to exclude the cost approach from the valuation process. Instead, the income or sales approach should be used to ensure a fair and accurate assessment of the property's value. A market-based reconciliation is suggested to rectify the suspected overassessment.

Subject: Property Tax Appeal Narrative for Overassessed Property

Dear Board Members,

I am writing to appeal the current property tax assessment for the subject property, which is currently assessed at $313.00 per square foot (SF). This assessment is significantly higher than the market median of $117.00 per SF, which suggests that the property is overassessed.

We have conducted a thorough analysis of comparable properties in the market area, and the median $/SF is indeed $117.00. This discrepancy between the assessed and market median values indicates that the subject property's assessment is not in line with its fair market value.

In light of the evidence presented, we propose a reconciled assessment rate of $117.00 per SF, which aligns with the market median. This adjustment would bring the assessed value in line with the market value, ensuring a fair and equitable assessment.

By applying the proposed $/SF rate of $117.00 to the total square footage of the property, we can conclude a new market value. However, without the total square footage of the property, we cannot provide a specific market value at this time.

We respectfully request the Board's consideration of this appeal and the proposed adjustment to the assessed value. We believe this adjustment will accurately reflect the subject property's market value and ensure fair property taxation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

## Income Approach

Subject: Property Tax Appeal Narrative for Capitalized Value Calculation

Dear Board Members,

I am writing to provide a detailed explanation of the income approach calculation conducted for the subject property. The income approach is a reliable method to ascertain the value of a property based on its income-generating potential. It is particularly applicable for income-producing properties and is generally accepted as a fair valuation method in the real estate industry.

The subject property has been rented at $18.0 NNN. This rental rate is in line with the prevailing market rates for similar properties in the same geographic area, considering factors such as property type, size, location, condition, and amenities. The rent has been established based on armâ€™s length transactions, ensuring a fair and unbiased rate.

The property has a vacancy rate of 9.4%, which is a realistic reflection of the current market conditions. The vacancy rate is an important factor in the income approach as it directly affects the Net Operating Income (NOI). It is worth noting that the vacancy rate used in this calculation is consistent with the average vacancy rates for similar properties in the local market.

The capitalization rate (Cap Rate) used in the calculation is 9.5%. This rate is derived from market evidence and reflects the return a typical investor would require for a property of this type and risk profile. The Cap Rate is a crucial component in the income approach, as it converts the NOI into a property value.

The Net Operating Income (NOI) for the property is $683,941.21. The NOI is the total potential income the property can generate, less operating expenses. This figure is a direct reflection of the property's ability to generate income and is a key input in the income approach.

The resulting capitalized value of the property, based on the above inputs, is $7,199,381.18, which equates to $171.66 per square foot. This value represents the worth of the property based on its income-generating potential. 

In conclusion, the income approach calculation for the subject property has been conducted using reasonable and justifiable inputs. These inputs reflect the property's current rental rate, vacancy rate, Cap Rate, and NOI. The resulting capitalized value is a fair representation of the property's value based on its ability to generate income.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

## Conclusion

Subject: Property Tax Appeal Narrative - Recommendation for Adjusted Assessment

Dear Board Members,

I am writing to present the findings of our recent property tax assessment review, conducted by our expert consultant CHARLY. The review has identified two major issues that warrant your attention and necessitate an appeal for an adjusted assessment.

The first issue pertains to a suspected overassessment of the property. The current assessment stands at $313.0/SF, which significantly exceeds the market median of $117.0/SF. This discrepancy suggests an overvaluation of the property in the tax assessment, which is not in line with the current market conditions. We recommend a market-based reconciliation to address this issue and bring the assessment in alignment with the prevailing market rates.

The second issue identified during the review is the inappropriate use of the Cost Approach for the property valuation. Given the property's likely exposure to major depreciation and obsolescence, the Cost Approach does not provide an accurate representation of its true value. Instead, we recommend the use of either the Income Approach or the Sales Comparison Approach. These methods take into account the property's income potential and recent sales of comparable properties, respectively, providing a more accurate and fair valuation.

Based on these findings, we recommend a reassessment of the property using the Sales Comparison Approach and the Income Approach. This will ensure a fair and accurate property tax assessment that reflects the property's current market value and income potential. We believe this will result in a more equitable assessment that aligns with the principles of fair taxation.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter. We look forward to working with you to ensure a fair and accurate property tax assessment.
